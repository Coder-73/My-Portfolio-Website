My A very small Experience and big views about success...
I love to solve problems. Even If I get a lot of obstacles or problems in the path of solution of the problem, but in the starting, I did not like them much, even I got panic sometimes ^_^. But then slowly slowly I started liking them. Because when the problem is solved not only do we get success, we come to know about a lot of things (And a lot of times failure). What is that thing? Yes, that's the process. I didn't stop anywhere. ''Success is not a thing which we have to achieve, It's a journey.''. It doesn't mean that you got success, now you will just stop saying, yes I got success. No, it's not that thing that you got success once and you will not have to work more. Success is that thing, that only comes to the persons who work hard. It doesn't matter what is your color, hairstyle, how expensive are your clothes, or what have you worn. Success will only see your hard work, smart work, and discipline. And in the last I would like to present some lines in front of you-'0 and 1, these are great numbers not only in computers. These are the only thing which happens to us all Sometimes we get 0(fail) and sometimes 1(pass), but never stop!'.
